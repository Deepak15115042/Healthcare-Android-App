# Healthcare
Health Care App will have the information of diseases, symptoms,prevention, causes, medicines prescription and their composition all 
present at a single place offline.

# About The App 

1. I worked on Android Studio and program the database using Java, XML and SQL. We will provide the user to create their login id and search medicine through name of disease or symptoms.

2. User will be provided with the option of adding new relevant data, which will be cross verified and we will update our database.

3. It will also recommend the hospitals nearby the user based on their location.

4. It will also suggest prevention of disease and take the feedback from user of their experience on our software.


# Results and Analysis 

After implementing all the methods and algorithm we are able to get all the information via searching through disease and multiple symptoms. We are
also able to manage the unique id of each user and store the data corresponding to particular user.
Hospital recommendation is also implemented in the application which takes user gps coordinate and display all the hospitals and their information nearby him.
We have also implemented the data addition features by the user, where user can add relevant data in the database which will be added after verification
by specialist.
